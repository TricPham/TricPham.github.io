# Something old
  Unlike the previous subjects that we went through in the course, web building was something I already had experiences with. In the project section of this site, I have showcased my team final project for the web development class I'd took at Kapi'olani Community College. It was a simple 6 page site that promnoted a fake tour company. Looking back at it, it look pretty busy, distracting, and too colorful. There are too much elements in the front and the alternating color pattern, was at the time to differentiate each box. However upon recently reflection, those elements seems to cover up the lack of details in the products. At the time, I wasn't very focused/interested in learning web design and thus had a hard time with it. I figure it was for the more creative people. Even now while I have a better understanding of it, I still feel it's not my cup of tea but I do know how to do it. The first site I've ever made had like 3 solid colors filling up the entire page. I would link it here but it I've lost the data for it.
  
# Something New
  Semantic UI wasn't really that bad once you look at each element as a box. You take the biggest box and put in a smaller box like a nesting doll
