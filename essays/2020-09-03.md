I've had experiences with a couple different languages like Java, C, Visual Basic. They have the same flow, the same gist like every programming language; make a variable, assign it a data type, do something with it.
You know, standard procedure but javascript is pretty different. It's not as strict allowing one to get away with some stuffs like return two differnt data type in a function.
Which is useful sometimes, other times it makes troubleshooting a bit complicated. Javascript ES6 is trying to making coding more streamline by bypassing tradtional syntax like
```
function myFunc(name) {
  return 'Hello' + name;
}
```
to
```
const myFunc(name) = name =>'Hello ${name}';
```
