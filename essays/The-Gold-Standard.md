  Standards aren't really all that impressive, they are an agreed upon minimal so that practices would be the same. Standards aren't bad, they keep things consistent making it easy to comprehend. Coding standards are the same, keeping codes similar so that different language are easier to understand and neat. I don't mind the standard, they are useful for keeping it clean. Following them is just slightly annoying when it comes to the small details like how many indentation are needed. It's hard to keep track of and even more so when on a time limit. I'm too busy trying to get the code to work before I make them pretty. I try to follow the standard as much as I can while I'm coding but I will make mistake, it's inevitable. I understand that the coding standard is meant to help us learn and develop better habits and sometimes it actually help me troubleshoot the problems. Sometimes I placed an extra bracket or make the line of code too long and the warning pops up telling me nah man that's wrong. Now if only it can help me with the logic, that would be great. 
  
  So far I have spent a week playing Intellij and ESLint, an ide and a script that checks code against a standard. The ide is pretty nice and fancy with all of the auto fills. I've only used eclipse and VI for java and C coding respectively, nothing of this caliber previously. ESLint was annoying to setup initally however I managed to get through it without losing too much of my mind. The first time I used it was a bit complicated since I thought it would autofix the problem if I were to click on the lightbulb that showed up. But now it's a very useful tool, it teaches how to fix the problem if I were to look up what was wrong with it. The green checkmark is kind of both useful and misleading. It tells you that the code was grammatically correct but it only tells you it's grammatically correct. Every time I see it, I'm like alright it's done, press run, and it doesn't work. Somewhere in my head it make sense that the green checkmark indicate the program is 100% working. ESLint is also very eager to tell you that you're doing something wrong. Everything I start writing a function, it would flag it as unused. I mean it's not wrong but I do need to finish the function before I can call it.
