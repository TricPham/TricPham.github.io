# Mostly patterns, some designs

Patterns are abundant and everywhere; sometimes simple and upfront, other time complex and hidden. One could find a pattern in mostly anything and in programing there are plenty. That is not to say it is a bad thing, not everything has to be creative or unique. You still need the fundamentals to make sure the program is stable. Design patterns is an umbrella term for designs that show up frequently that works in a given environment. For example, a house designed in Canada would not work in someplace like Egypt due to the environment being completely different, but it could work in Norway. Similar to programing, there are certain designs that consistently pop up due to it ability to solve problems. There is a brunch of design patterns, the following are just some of the more popular.

 Factory, as its name implies behave similar to a real-life factory, the one the create certain stuffs. One would use a factory when you want to create objects without revealing how it is done and letting the object be molded or have more functions. It is akin to a Coke-Cola factory, there are some secrets that are not shown, and the end product have slight variation a la flavors.
 
A Singleton is an object that is meant to be globally access throughout the program in a language that does not allow global variables. This allows for program to keep track of data from one class to another. How one does it is up to them, most if not all design pattern are concepts that can be adapted as one will. 

The Observer design is for event driven system, or for a reactive system. There are so many examples of this type of design, it is literally everywhere. The best example is the fire alarm system; the fire detector is the observer that will send a message the system and trigger the alarm. 

The model view controller sounds very complicated at first, but it is really just the interaction of the user with the program through a GUI. Every single website you have interact with is a model view controller, the way the data is presented is not the way model is made. By clicking or sometime hovering over something, the view changes allowing the controller more options.
