summary: A digital virtual experience

Due to Covid, a lot of activites and pastimes are put on hold to stop the spread of the virus. One of them is going to the theatre to watch people perform, can't really put a couple hundred people in a room at this current time.
The goal of this project is to let people experience a play at home via a game. We're are still in the early talk of how to approach this project but the way it differ from a movie is the audience interaction. According to the other members, there is a interaction between the actors on stage and the audience, I haven't quite understand this yet.
As of 9/4/20, we have just begun formulating ideas. I'm bringing in my experiences with gaming and coding while they are the script writter and director. This would be a challenge as we have to maintain the border of actor and audience while letting the audience engage along side the story. The premise of the story revolves around races and how the justice system differ between them.
